The first three digits `a.b.c` represent the official n8n version, while the optional fourth digit `.d` indicates additional modifications or bug fixes made by me. If no such changes were applied, the fourth digit may be omitted.

For example: `1.98.1.1`  
This indicates that the base version is **n8n 1.98.1**, and the final `.1` refers to a custom update or patch applied on top of that version.
